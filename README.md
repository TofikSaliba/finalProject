[DEMO Link](https://tofik-helping-hand.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

The project idea <strong>Helping-Hand</strong> was inspired by my
experience in 2021 where i have volunteered to a program helping old
people especially those who have been severely affected by the pandemic,
There i was assigned to be with <strong>Ali Heib</strong>, to help him
with daily things, visit him and try to have a good time, take him
places he would like to visit and sometimes i even helped him in his
farm for the very simply reason that i enjoyed his company so much!
